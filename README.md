# vue-plugin-template

> âœ¨ DX experience & smaller libs ðŸš€


## Usage

```bash
vue init posva/vue-plugin-template
```

## Features

### Smaller plugin size
Bundle with [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)

### Single file components
Write your components using `.vue` files. Those will be compiled into render
functions when building your plugin to make them compatible everywhere.

### JSX
Add jsx to your `js` files and they will be compiled as well.

### ES6
Use the future features of Javascript

### Advanced testing
Get the best developer experience by testing the components at the same time you
see them **rendered**. Embrace [Visual testing](#TODO) ðŸ˜Ž
