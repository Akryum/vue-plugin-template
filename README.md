## ⚠️ This is not yet a plugin

At the moment is more a boilerplate that anything else. It'll be soon
transformed into a vue template so you can use to start a vue plugin or
component library with `vue init posva/vue-plugin-template`.

However, you can clone and play around or even copy features to your project.
